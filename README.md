# Baba-is-You
This is a little project in C trying to replicate some of the behavior of the puzzle game Baba is You.
In each level, the player is presented with a one-screen puzzle consisting of various objects, characters, and movable word tiles.
The game centers around the manipulation of "rules" represented in level by movable tiles with the meaning ascribed to them.

Lower case letters represent text.
Uppercase letters represent objects.

H - hedge; R - rock; F - flag; O - oso(baba in original game); T - tiger;
i - is; p - push; s - stop; y - you; w - win; d - defeat;

W, A, S, D - move; R - restart; Z - undo;
 
To create a rule a sentence must be made. Examples:
fiw - flag is win
rip - rock is push
oiy - oso is you
